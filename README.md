# Randomized-Spirograph
Project idea from Python Playground by Mahesh Venkitachalam. This project draws randomized spirographs,
but can accept arguments through CLI.

  Details
  - Project takes maybe 2 days, 1 day if you really commmit
  - The gcd module from the original syntax in Python Playground book is located in math rather than fractions
  - Project is not hard to understand, there isnt many complicated concepts 
  - Will eventually add a function that entails reccursion
